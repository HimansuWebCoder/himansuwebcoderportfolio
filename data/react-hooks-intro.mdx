# 🪝 Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how developers write React components. Before Hooks, state and lifecycle features were only available in class components. Now, with Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, you can manage state and side effects directly in functional components.

Hooks make your code cleaner and easier to understand. For example, `useState` lets you add state to a function, while `useEffect` handles side effects like data fetching. There are also custom hooks for sharing logic across components.

If you’re new to React or still using class components, now is the perfect time to learn Hooks and modernize your workflow!
