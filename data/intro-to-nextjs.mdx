# 🚀 Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful **React framework** that has become one of the most popular choices for building modern web applications. Developed by **Vercel**, it extends the capabilities of React by providing features like **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **API routes**, making it a complete solution for both frontend and backend development.

Unlike traditional React apps, where rendering happens entirely on the client side, Next.js allows developers to choose how each page should be rendered. This flexibility improves **performance, SEO, and user experience**. For example, e-commerce websites can use SSR for dynamic product pages, while blogs can use SSG for faster load times.

Next.js also comes with **built-in routing**, meaning you don’t need third-party libraries like React Router. File-based routing makes navigation simple — just add a new file in the `pages/` directory, and it automatically becomes a route.

Other notable features include **API routes** (to build serverless functions), **Image Optimization** (faster image loading), and **Internationalization (i18n)** support. With its seamless developer experience and production-ready features, Next.js has become the go-to choice for startups, enterprises, and solo developers alike.

🔥 In short, Next.js helps you build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications with ease.
